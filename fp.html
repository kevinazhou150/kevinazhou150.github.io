Besides being a math major, I also am interested in functional programming and programming language theory.
I have been a teacher assistant for 15-150, principles of functional programming, seven times!
(And I was a head TA once, which taught me just how difficult and rewarding it is to be a leader.)
</p>
<p>
During my time I've come up with lots of interesting problems, so I'll share my favorite contributions here.
</p>

<p>
<b>Probability Trees</b> (Joint effort primarily with Brandon (old), Aileen, George, and Thea) <br><br>
It's a cool idea to model probability trees in a programming language. There's
<i>local</i> probability trees, where each node tells the probabilities of getting to each of the node's children.
It's easy to add events to such a probability tree, but difficult to find the probability of an outcome.<br>
On the other hand, there are <i>cumulative</i> probability trees, where each node tells the probability of getting
to that node from the root. Here it's easy to find the probability of an outcome, but adding an event would require
reweighting all the nodes' values! <br><br>
We wrote a problem that explores these differences, while allowing students to practice with datatypes in Standard ML. 
It was also my first time writing a full-fledged autograder,
which was fun but also extremely demanding. Thea rescued me at the end to fix all my bugs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Staging</b><br><br>
One motivation of higher order functions is the ability to stage computation.
I wrote a problem that shows students in real time how staging can lead to more efficient code:
for large $n$, it's better to sort a list once and then query $n$ times, 
than to query $n$ times on an unsorted list.<br><br>
I also wrote silly flavortext: the Lambda Bakery, famous for their m<i>int</i> chocolate chip cookies,
<i>int</i>erviws the student on how to serve their customers faster. 
The solution is to do all the meal preparation first and then serve customers,
rather than to do meal preparation from scratch each time a new customer walks in!
</p>

<p>
<b>AIV tracker</b> (Joint effort with Suhas, Yosef, Thea, and countless others)

</p>

<p>
    <b>Sequence of Frogs</b>
    

</p>


<p>
<b>Paths and Cycles</b>

</p>

<p>
    <b>The MODULE Module</b>
    
    </p>


<p>
    <b>Arithmetic in an arbitrary base</b><br><br>
    There wasn't ever room for this problem, but I think it's a fun exercise with lists.<br>
    We can represent integers with a list of digits. (This lets us avoid integer overflow!)
    There is a slick recursive way to implement addition on such integers.
    We can also use these integers to tackle brute-force problems (such as finding Schur triples)
    without backtracking.<br><br>
    Since this problem was never released, I feel safe sharing the writeup here. I'm pretty proud of it!
