    I'm primarily interested in combinatorics and topology. 
    I love seeing unexpected connections between different areas of math!
    Here's some blurbs about research I've done:
</p>
<h3>Convex Codes</h3>
<p>
    Suppose there are 3 convex sets $U_1, U_2, U_3$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and we know the following:
    <ul>
        <li> There exists a point in both $U_1$ and $U_2$. In other words, $U_1, U_2$ overlap.
            Similarly $U_1, U_3$ overlap and $U_2, U_3$ overlap.
        <li> There exists a point in only $U_1$. There also exists a point only in $U_2$, and a point only in $U_3$.
        <li> There isn't a point in $U_1, U_2, U_3$ all at once.
    </ul>
    Then we know that the sets have to roughly form the shape of a triangle, with a hole in the middle:
</p>

<p>
    Since writing out the above description of how the sets overlap is tedious, we have notation: we can instead
    write the <b>code</b> $\{12, 13, 23, 1, 2, 3, \emptyset \}$. 
    Then we say the above image is a convex realization of this code. 
</p>
<p>
    I am studying box-convex realizations, where we require the sets to be boxes (Cartesian products of intervals).
    With Brenda, Kina, Miguel, and Tiffany, under the guidance of Dr. Amzi Jeffs, we discovered this powerful theorem:
</p>
<p>
   <b>Product Theorem:</b> Let $\mathcal U = \{U_1, U_2, \cdots, U_n\}$ be a family of sets in $\mathbb{R}^{d_1}$ 
    and $\mathcal V = \{V_1, V_2, \cdots, V_n\}$ be a family of sets in $\mathbb{R}^{d_2}$. 
    Define $\mathcal W = \{W_1, W_2, \cdots, W_n\}$, where $W_i = U_i \times V_i$ for $i = 1, 2, \cdots, n$.
    Then,
</p>
<p>
    $\text{code}(\mathcal W) = \{c_1 \cap c_2 : c_1 \in \text{code}(U), c_2 \in \text{code}(V) \}$
</p>
This theorem allows us to predict the code of a family of sets, based on its decomposition into lower dimensions!
It's most applicable for boxes, because a box in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be decomposed into $d$ intervals.

The product theorem is incredibly overpowered. We can do the following:
<ul>
    <li>For properties that are true in 1 dimension, we can extend them to boxes in $d$ dimensions.
        For example, it's known that a realization of a code with intervals can be
        massaged to all have integer coordinates between 0 and 2n. (This is since there are
        2n endpoints, and only the endpoints matter.) From this, we can show that 
        a realization of a code with boxes can be massaged so that the coordinates in all 
        dimensions are between 0 and 2n. I would have used an exclamation mark at the end 
        of that sentence to show excitement but it could've been mistaken for a factorial,
        so the exclamation point was moved here instead! </li>
    <li> We can write a relatively efficient algorithm to classify box-convex codes.
        For a given $n$, we first classify all codes on $n$ indices in 1 dimension.
        Then, we take the "intersection product" (the resulting code from the product theorem above)
        of 1 dimensional codes to get codes realizable in 2D. And we "intersection product" a 2D code with 
        a 1D code to get a 3D code, and so on! </li>
    <li> We can also manually study codes to see whether they are box-convex. For example, consider the code 
        $\{12, 13, 23, 1, 2, 3, \emptyset \}$ from above. Can we rigorously prove this is not box-convex in any
        dimension? There is probably some geometrical argument, but instead... <br><br>
        First, it's relatively simple to prove $\{12, 13, 23, 1, 2, 3, \emptyset \}$ is not realizable in 1 dimension
        (try drawing it out and using contradiction). <br><br>
        Then, suppose that there is a box realization in $d$ dimensions of $\{12, 13, 23, 1, 2, 3, \emptyset \}$.
        We can decompose the boxes into three $d-1$ dimensional sets, and three intervals. 
        The codes of those trios of sets must "intersection product" together to be $\{12, 13, 23, 1, 2, 3, \emptyset \}$,
        by our product theorem. There is some casework involved, but it's possible to show 
        that the $d-1$ dimensional trio must realize the code $\{12, 13, 23, 1, 2, 3, \emptyset \}$. But wait!
        Now we can go to $d-2$ dimensions, then $d-3$ dimensions, and so on! The formal argument would be by induction.
</ul>
